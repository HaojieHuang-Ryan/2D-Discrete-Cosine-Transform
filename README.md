# 2D-Discrete-Cosine-Transform
Q.2. 2D (Discrete Cosine Transform) Read N (an integer between 2 and 10) and then an input matrix of size NxN, print out the 2D DCT transform result (rounding to integers). See Slide 41 in Lossy compression for an example. Note that you canâ€™t call any lib to do this; you have to write your own code to implement the matrix operation.
